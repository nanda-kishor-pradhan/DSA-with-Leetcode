# QUes No 83 - Remove Duplicates from Sorted Listnode

# Problem Statement:
# Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
# Output: [1,2,5]

n3 = Listnode(2)
n4 = Listnode(4)
n5 = Listnode(5)

n1.next = n2 
n2.next = n3
n3.next = n4
n4.next = n5
