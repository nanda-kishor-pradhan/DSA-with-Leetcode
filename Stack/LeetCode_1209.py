# Ques No 1209 - Remove all Adjacent Duplicates in String-ii 

# Problem Statement:
# You are given a string s and an integer k, a k duplicate removal consists of choosing k adjacent and equal letters from s and removing them,
#  causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

# We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.

# Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
# Output: "abcd"
# Explanation: There's nothing to delete.

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
# Output: "aa"
# Explanation: 
# First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
# Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
# Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"

# Example 3:

# Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
# Output: "ps"
